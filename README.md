# HeyWidgets

HeyWidgets is a collection of **native** Android widgets designed to bring the clean, aesthetic design language of Pixel devices (Material You) to any Android smartphone.

## 🚀 The Story Behind HeyWidgets

I am a huge fan of "bloat-free" Android experiences and the design philosophy of Pixel devices. Unfortunately, since Pixel phones are not officially sold in my country, I’ve had to find alternative ways to bring that experience to my daily driver.

For years, I used **KWGT** to recreate these widgets. However, I constantly ran into synchronization issues. The calendar events wouldn't update reliably, weather data would lag, and the overall experience felt heavy on system resources.

I decided it was time to build my own solution. By using **Kotlin** and native Android components, I created widgets that talk directly to the system, ensuring they are lightweight, fast, and always in sync. I’m gathering all the widgets I build for myself in this app. If you find them useful, feel free to use them!

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

Currently, the app features two core widgets:

### 1. At a Glance 
The signature Pixel experience that provides dynamic information right on your home screen.
* **Smart Calendar:** Tracks your upcoming events in real-time with direct deep-links to your calendar app.
* **Personalized Greeting:** Greets you by name based on the time of day (Good Morning, Afternoon, etc.).
* **Weather Integration:** Displays current temperature and conditions based on your global settings.
* **Native Sync:** Unlike third-party tools, this stays updated without draining your battery.

### 2. Pixel Weather (Pill Widget)
Inspired by the modern weather widget introduced with the Pixel 9 series.
* **Customizable Shapes:** Choose between left-leaning or right-leaning pill designs.
* **Material You Support:** Fully adapts its colors based on your system theme (Light, Dark, or Dynamic/Material You).
* **High-Fidelity Rendering:** Uses custom bitmap drawing for crisp text and icons.

- **Global Configuration:** Manage location, temperature units (°C/°F), and sync frequency from a single dashboard that affects all widgets simultaneously.
- **Bloat-Free & Lightweight:** No unnecessary libraries or background tracking.
- **Always Improving:** I plan to add more widget designs to this collection in the future.
